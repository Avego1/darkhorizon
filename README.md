# Dark Horizon Network

DHN is a **TOR enabled**, Blockchain with a maximum PoW supply of **60,000 DHN**. By combining a **2MB Max Block Size** and **10 second target block time** with low transaction fees DHN offers everything you've been looking for in a quality Blockchain **<< now**.

## DNS Defence

In addition to using traditional DNS Seed Servers for peer discovery, DHN recognizes and addresses the risks, limitations and weaknesses of the traditional DNS system. By maintaining a presence on the Emercoin Distributed DNS Blockchain the Dark Horizon Network domain name records for:

* darkhorizonnetwork.coin
* darkhorizon.coin

are completely decentralized, uncensorable and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. This approach offers the DHN user an additional layer of network security and accessibility by being able to locate active DHN nodes without being reliant on legacy DNS architecture.

## Value Relativity

Whatever value means to you, however you decide to measure it, consider that... In terms of coin circulation, the maximum PoW supply of 60,000 makes DHN **350x** more scarce than Bitcoin which has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC.
On measures of service, Bitcoin has a hardcoded block time of 10 minutes whereas the hardcoded block time for DHN is 10 Seconds.

## Transparency

Full source code code for the DHN is available on github and community engagement and support is always welcome.
